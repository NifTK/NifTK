\page InstallationInstructions The Installation Instructions

\section InstallationInstructionsIntroduction Introduction

The instructions are for if you have downloaded a binary package.

Each @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ binary package installs a suite of software, and extra steps are needed to setup your system 
after the installer runs. These steps are important. Without these steps you will have 
either fewer programs available, or programs that do not run correctly.
Please see the instructions below.

\section InstallationInstructionsMac Mac OSX

<ol>
<li> Download a .dmg file, and double click to "mount" it.
<li> You will see two folder. One named /Applications and one named @NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@. Drag and drop the @NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@ folder onto the Applications folder. 
<li> The software will install into /Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
<li> In Finder, you will see for example an icon for NiftyView.app and possibly other icons for other graphical user interfaces. 
Each of these icons represents a bundle containing the main interface eg. NiftyView, and also command line programs and scripts.
<li> In your shell startup script ~/.bash_profile put for example
\verbatim
export PATH=/Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@/NiftyView.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH
\endverbatim
and similarly for other bundles.
<li> Don't forget that when the version number changes, you have to change the PATH for the new version.
</ol>

\section InstallationInstructionsLinux Linux

<ol>
<li> Download the .tar.gz file, into the directory you want to install into. For these instructions 
    we will call this <INSTALL_DIR>, which should be substituted below for your installation dir. 
<li> Extract the tar file using:
\verbatim
tar -zxvf @NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@.tar.gz 
\endverbatim
<li> If you are running a bash shell put:
\verbatim
export NIFTK_DIR=<INSTALL_DIR>/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.sh
\endverbatim
in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile 
<li> Or if you are running a csh put:
\verbatim
setenv NIFTK_DIR <INSTALL_DIR>/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.csh
\endverbatim
in your ~/.cshrc
</ol>

Note: Depending on your Linux system administrator, your
shell startup scripts could be different ones, managed by your
system administrator. If in doubt ask your local admin.
For example at UCL Computer Science most managed machines use
a csh and the file to edit is ~/.uclcs-csh-options.

\section InstallationInstructionsWindows Windows

<ol>
<li> Download the .exe file
<li> Run the .exe file following the on-screen prompts.
<li> The software will install into "C:\Program Files\@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ @NIFTK_VERSION_STRING@".
<li> A desktop short-cut will enable you to run NiftyView and other graphical user interfaces.
<li> Command line programs will be in "C:\Program Files\@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ @NIFTK_VERSION_STRING@\bin".
<li> Scripts will not be available.
<li> If you want command line programs to be available from the command prompt, you must set your user or system PATH environment variable manually to "C:\Program Files\@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ @NIFTK_VERSION_STRING@\bin".
</ol>

\section Running the NiftyView application

Once correctly installed, NiftyView can be run as follows:
<ol>
<li> On Linux, you should run NiftyView.sh, which should be available if you set the PATH variable correctly above.
<li> On Windows, you can launch NiftyView from the Start menu then @NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@ then NiftyView, or from the Desktop icon if you selected that option, and also from the command line if you chose to add it to the system or user PATH.
<li> On a Mac, you can find the NiftyView icon in the /Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@ and drag it to the dock (which creates an alias), or create an alias to /Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@/NiftyView.app on your Desktop and run that.
On the command line you can run "open  /Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@/NiftyView.app" or if you set your PATH in ~/.bash_profile you can just run "NiftyView."
</ol>
and similarly for other graphical user interfaces.
