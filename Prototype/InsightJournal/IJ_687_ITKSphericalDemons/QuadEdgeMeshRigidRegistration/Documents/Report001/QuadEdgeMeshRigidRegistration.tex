\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a contribution to the Insight Toolkit intended to
support the process of registering two Meshes.  The methods included here are
restricted to Meshes with a Spherical geometry and topology, and with scalar
values associated to their nodes.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

The Insight Toolkit already provides methods for registering

\begin{itemize}
\item Image to Image
\item PointSet to Image
\item PointSet to PointSet
\end{itemize}

but it lacks methods for registering one Mesh versus another Mesh.

In this paper we contribute new classes that can be used for performing
registration between two spherical meshes, although not all of of the classes
in this contribution are restricted to be used on spherical meshes.

This paper is the first of a series related to implementing support for
deformable registration of Meshes according the method described in \cite{Yeo2008}.

\section{Overview}

The design of these classes follows very closely the one of the Image
Registration Framework in ITK.  In particular, we have the usual components

\begin{itemize}
\item Optimizer
\item Metric
\item Transform
\item Interpolator
\end{itemize}

and we have the two objects to be registered, in this case Meshes instead of
Images. The two main components that must be provided in order to support Mesh
registration are Iterpolators and Metrics.

\subsection{Mesh Interpolators}

Mesh-based Interpolators are designed here following the same structure of the
image interpolators. In particular, they derive from the \doxygen{Function}
class, and implement a sequence of 

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{itk::MeshFunction}
\item \code{itk::InterpolateMeshFunction}
\end{itemize}

 and finally, the siblings

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{itk::LinearInterpolateMeshFunction}
\item \code{itk::NearestNeighborInterpolateMeshFunction}
\end{itemize}

The diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:InterpolatorsClassHierarchy} presents the hierarchy of mesh
interpolators that are included in this contribution.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{InterpolatorsClassHierarchy.pdf}
\itkcaption[Interpolators Class Hierarchy]{Hierarchy of new Mesh Interpolator Classes.}
\label{fig:InterpolatorsClassHierarchy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mesh Metrics}

Mesh metrics follow a similar structure to the existing image metrics in ITK.
Their hierarchy starts with the \code{itk::MeshToMeshMetric} that derives from
the existing ITK class \doxygen{SingleValuedCostFunction}. They currently comprise
an abstract base class and a concrete class, as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{itk::MeshToMeshMetric}
\item \code{itk::MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetric}
\end{itemize}

It is expected that variations of Mesh metrics will be added as siblings of the
mean squares metric, just as variations of image metrics thrived in ITK.

The diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:MetricsClassHierarchy} presents the hierarchy of mesh
interpolators that are included in this contribution.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{MetricsClassHierarchy.pdf}
\itkcaption[Metrics Class Hierarchy]{Hierarchy of new Mesh Metric Classes.}
\label{fig:MetricsClassHierarchy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mesh Point Locator}

One of the challenging aspects of implementing an interpolator in Meshes is the
fact that given a point in space, it is not trivial to find the Mesh cell that
contains this point in its domain. The method used here involves the use of a
\code{PointLocator} class that internally constructs a Kd-Tree in order to provide
a spatial classification of the Mesh points.

When the registration method is mapping points from the Fixed Mesh into the
Moving Mesh, this points are first mapped through the Transform and then they
are passed to the interpolator's \code{Evaluate()} method. The first action of
this method is to locate the points from the Moving Mesh that are closest to
the point given as argument of Evaluate.

The \code{PointLocator} class takes advantage of the classes

\begin{itemize}
\item \doxygen{KdTreeGenerator}
\item \doxygen{PointSetToListSampleAdaptor} 
\end{itemize}

that are already provided by the ITK Statistics framework. The KdTree is
constructed from the Moving Mesh during the initialization process of the
interpolator, that is triggered by the Initialize() method of the Metric
itself.

\subsection{Triangle Basis System}

The \code{TriangleBasisSystem} is an auxiliary class that holds a vector basis
for a triangular cell of a Mesh. This vector basis is then used as a coordinate
system in order to compute barycentric coordinates of points in a given cell.
These barycentric coordinates are commonly used as weights for a linear
interpolation of values assigned to the nodes of the triangular cell.

In a Mesh of topological dimension M that is embedded in a N-Dimensional space,
this class will contains M vector of N components each. This class is
essentially a data container and it does not provide computational
capabilities.

\subsection{Triangle Basis System Calculator}

The \code{TriangleBasisSystemCalculator} is an auxiliary class that computes
the TriangleBasisSystem of a cell from an M-Dimensional Mesh embedded in a
N-Dimensional space.  Given a set of N points, the calculator will compute the
vectors of the basis.

\subsection{Triangle List Basis System Calculator}

The \code{TriangleListBasisSystemCalculator} is an auxiliary class that will
compute the triangle basis systems for all the cells of an input mesh.

Given that in the context of Mesh to Mesh registration, the triangle basis of
all the cells have to be computed eventually it results more efficient to
pre-compute these basis at the beginning of the process, instead of having them
computed on-demand as the points are sampled.

Note however that this is a design decision based on the assumption that users
will deal most of the time with meshes that are not very large, and for which
computation time is the main concern. If you are working with very large
meshes, then it may be desirable to modify this code to avoid the memory
allocation required for storing all the vector basis, and instead pay for the
computation time of these vector set at every call of the interpolator
\code{Evaluate()} method.

\subsection{FreeSurfer Binary Surface Reader}

FreeSurfer is and application developed by the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for
Biomedical Imaging. Developement was supported in part by the National Center
for Research Resources (P41-RR14075, R01 RR16594-01A1 and the NCRR BIRN
Morphometric Project BIRN002, U24 RR021382), the National Institute for
Neurological Disorders and Stroke (R01 NS052585-01), the National Institute of
Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, as well as the Mental Illness and
Neuroscience Discovery (MIND) Institute and is part of the National Alliance
for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) funded by the National Institutes of
Health through the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research, Grant U54 EB005149. 

Although FreeSurfer binaries can be freely downloaded, the application is
unfortunately not Open Source, and it uses is restricted to non-commercial
applications.

For details, see \url{http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/}.

The application for which these Mesh registration classes were developed was
the registration of brain surfaces that have been mapped to spheres. Surface 
data of this type is available as part of the binary download of Freesurface.

In order to facilitate the use of data generated from FreeSurfer as input to
the Mesh to Mesh registration framework we provide here a reader class that
read FreeSurfer binary files and convert them into
itkQuadEdgeMeshe\cite{Gouaillard2007}.

The minimalist use of the FreeSurferBinarySurfaceReader class is illustrated by
the source code below.


\begin{lstlisting}

  #include "itkMesh.h"
  #include "itkFreeSurferBinarySurfaceReader.h"

  typedef itk::Mesh<float, 3>                 MeshType;
  typedef itk::FreeSurferBinarySurfaceReader< MeshType >  ReaderType;

  ReaderType::Pointer  surfaceReader = ReaderType::New();

  surfaceReader->SetFileName("lh.pial");
  surfaceReader->SetDataFileName("lh.curv.pial");
  
  surfaceReader->Update();

  MeshType::ConstPointer mesh = surfaceReader->GetOutput();

\end{lstlisting}

Where 

\begin{itemize}
\item ``lh.pial'' is the file containing the geometry and topology of the mesh
\item ``lh.curv.pial'' is the file containing the scalar field associated with points of the mesh
\end{itemize}

In the \code{Examples} directory of the accompanying source code you will find an example called

\begin{verbatim} 
ConvertFreeSurferBinarySurfaceToVTKSurface.cxx
\end{verbatim} 

That, as the name indicates, can read a pair of FreeSurface files and read them
into an itkQuadEdgeMesh, to then save the surface as a VTK legacy file.


\section{How to Perform Registration}

This section illustrates how to put together a Mesh to Mesh registration
example. The code presented in this section is available in the subdirectory
Examples, in the file

\begin{verbatim} 
MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx
\end{verbatim} 

\subsection{Including Headers}

We start by including the headers of the main components of the registration framework

\begin{itemize}
\item Metric
\item Transform
\item RegistrationMethod
\item Interpolator
\item Mesh
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={22-27}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}

Then we include headers for auxiliary classes. In particular, 

\begin{itemize}
\item The Command class that will be used to observe the progress of the registration process via events.
\item The Mesh reader that will load the meshes from files.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={29-30}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Defining a Command Observer}

The command observer class is defined in a very similar way to what you may
have already seen in the image registration framework. The code would be almost
identical to what is shown in the ITK Software Guide \cite{ITKSoftwareGuideSecondEdition}

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={33-74}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}


\subsection{Declaring the Mesh Types}

The fundamental type used in the registration process is the Mesh. In this case
we chose to use the \code{QuadEdgeMesh} because we are dealing with 2D
manifolds embedded in a 3D space. For details on the design and implementation
of QuadEdgeMeshes please see \cite{Gouaillard2007}.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={92-93}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}

We are using here two Meshes of the same type, but in principle, we could have
used two different mesh types, as long as their space dimension is the same.

\subsection{Reading the Meshes from Files}

Using the Mesh types as template parameters, we can instantiate the types of
the mesh readers and proceed to load the meshes into memory. Note that this is
optional, since you could be inserting the registration code into an
application in which the Meshes are generated through means different from file
reading.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={95-113}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}

Note that, as usual, the \code{Update()} methods are called inside a
\code{try/catch} block in order to deal with potential Exceptions that may
result from problems in the process of reading the Mesh files.

After updating the readers we can extract the fixed and moving meshes and
assign them to temporary variables.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={115-116}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}


\subsection{Declaring the Registration Method}

We instantiate the registration method by using the Mesh types as template parameters

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={118-122}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}


\subsection{Declaring the Metric}

We instantiate the metric type by using the Mesh types as template parameters.
The we construct one metric and connect it to the registration method.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={124-130}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Connecting the input Meshes}

The Fixed and Moving input meshes are connected to the registration method.
Note that the order of this call is irrelevant, as long as it is done before
calling the \code{StartRegistration()} method.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={133-134}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Declaring the Transform}

Here we use the \doxygen{VersorTransform} because we only expect to apply
rotations to the spherical meshes. The template parameter of the Transform is
the type that will be used internally for performing computations. We get this
type as a trait from the Metric type, which in turn defined this trait based on
the NumericTraits of the Mesh's coordinate representation type.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={137-141}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}


\subsection{Declaring the Interpolator}

As we map points from the Fixed mesh into the Moving mesh, most of these points
will land in the middle of the moving mesh cells. For this reason, we need an
interpolator in order to compute the values of the Moving mesh scalar field and
its derivatives at those locations. Here we select to use the linear
interpolator for meshes.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={144-148}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}


\subsection{Initializing Transform Parameters}

In some registration processes, the user may have an idea of what could be a
good initial Transform. It is very important to convey this information to the
registration framework, because it sets the optimizer in a much better location
for exploring the cost function (Metric).  In this particular case we take the
initial values of the Transform from the command line parameters and use them
to set the components of the rotation axis and the rotation angle. Then we get
the parameters of the transform and pass them to the registration method.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={156-169}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}


\subsection{Setting the Optimizer}


\subsubsection{Declaration}

The VersorTransform parameters do not form a Vector space due to the fact that
the addition operation is not equivalent to composition of rotation in the
Versor space. For this reason we have to use here an Optimizer that is aware of
this particularity of the space of rotations. Our choice is the
\doxygen{VersorTransformOptimizer}. Here we instantiate the optimizer and
connect it to the registration method.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={172-176}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{Transform Parameter Scaling}

The parametric space in which the Optimizer explores the cost function (the
Metric) is not necessarily isotropic.  Most ITK optimizers provide a mechanism
for users to specify the different scales of the particular dimensions of the
parametric space. In this specific case, however, the three components of the
Versor are of similar scale, and therefore we can set all the scaling parameter
values to the same number.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={179-186}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}



\subsubsection{Optimizer Parameters Fine Tunning}

One of the most critical aspects of performing registration is to identify the
values for the parameters of the optimizer. These parameters are the ones
controlling the behavior of the optimizer as it explores the parametric space
of the Transform. Inappropriate values of this parameters will lead to the
optimizer getting trapped in local minima, or running for too many iterations,
or not enough iterations.

Unfortunately, the process of selecting Optimizer parameters is not an exact
science and requires a systematic process of trial and error. This is where
most of the effort of registration is spent by users.

The following parameters turn out to be appropriate for registering the
FixedMesh.vtk in the data directory with itself.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={188-193}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}



\subsubsection{Connecting the Observer to the Optimizer}

The Command observer that we defined at the beginning of this example, is now
connected to the Optimizer.  This will report the value of the Metric along
with the parameters of the Transform at every iteration of the optimization.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={196-197}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}


\subsection{Running the Registration}

We are finally ready for running the registration. This is done by calling the
\code{StartRegistration} method. We place this call inside a \code{try/catch}
block in order to be able to manage any potential Exception that may be thrown
as a result of an internal error during the registration process.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={199-208}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}


The command line used for running the registration is

\begin{verbatim} 
MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1  FixedMesh.vtk MovingMesh.vtk 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.1
\end{verbatim} 

Where the first three numbers after the MovingMesh.vtk parameter are the
components of the rotation axis, and the last numeric parameter is the initial
angle of rotation expressed in radians.


\subsection{Print out the Registration Results}

Naturally, after running the registration, we want to look at the final
results. This is done by calling the \code{GetLastTransformParameters()} method
as illustrated in the lines below.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={211-217}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistration1.cxx}
\end{center}


\section{Visually Monitoring the Registration Process}

Following the behavior of the registration process is another one of the
challenging aspects of performing registration. Often times it is frustrating
for users to spend long hours running a registration process without having
proper feedback on whether the optimizer is heading in the right direction in
the parametric space.

This section illustrates how to use a helper class that provides visual
feedback as the iteration process is ongoing.

The code can be found in the Examples directory, in the file

\begin{verbatim} 
MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistrationWithMonitor1.cxx
\end{verbatim} 

This file is a slightly modified version of the example that we described in
the previous section.


\subsection{Including the Registration Monitor}

The first difference between this example and the previous one is that here we
replace the Command observer with a class called \code{RegistrationMonitor}.
This new class provides visual feedback by using VTK classes to display a
rendering of the surface as it is mapped by the Transform at every iteration of
the registration process.

The RegistrationMonitor class requires vtkPolyData types as inputs, therefore
we redundantly load the meshes into vtkPolyData structures by using the
vtkPolyDataReader class.

We need to include the following headers

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={33-36}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistrationWithMonitor1.cxx}
\end{center}


\subsection{Loading Surfaces into PolyData}

In order to load the Fixed and Moving meshes into vtkPolyData classes we use
two instances of the vtkPolyDataReader class. This is, unfortunately, a
duplication of memory from the Meshes that we already read into itkMesh classes.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={159-169}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistrationWithMonitor1.cxx}
\end{center}


\subsection{Instantiating the Registration Monitor}

We proceed now to instantiate the RegistrationMonitor, connect the surfaces to
it, and set the parameters that define how often the visualization is going to
be updated.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={172-179}]{../../Examples/MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetricRegistrationWithMonitor1.cxx}
\end{center}

The most interesting line is the call to the
\code{SetNumberOfIterationsPerUpdate} method. This method defines how many
iterations of the optimizer should pass between refreshes of the surface
rendering display. For the purpose of this example we render the surface at
every iteration, hence the value ``1''. However, this has the disadvantage that
we are probably spending more CPU cycles in performing rendering and
visualization than in actually computing the registration.

In a more realistic scenario, we probably should use a value of 10 or 50, to
let the optimizer make more progress in the registration before we spend time
in updating the surface rendering.

The use of the RegistrationMonitor is mostly an scaffolding intended to assist
the user as it is figuring out proper values for all the numeric parameters
used in the registration process. Once you have identified good values for all
these parameters you probably want to remove the RegistrationMonitor from the
code, given that at that point it is not contributing much to bringing the
registration to completion.
